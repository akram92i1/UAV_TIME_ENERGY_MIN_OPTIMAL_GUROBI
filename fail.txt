This output is from the Gurobi Optimizer, a mathematical optimization solver. It is indicating that the optimization problem being solved is infeasible. This means that there is no solution that satisfies all of the constraints in the model. The problem has 9 rows (constraints), 45 columns (variables), and 21 nonzeros (non-zero coefficients in the constraints). The variables are either continuous or integer, with 9 of them being binary. The model was attempted to be optimized with 2 objectives, but only 1 was combined. The optimization of the first objective resulted in an infeasible solution. The best objective and best bound are undefined, and the gap is undefined as well.
